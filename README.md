## User Experience (UX)

### User Goal

 - The user's main goal is to have easy and affordable access to the tools they need to perform specific tasks, whether for home repairs or professional jobs, without the cost and commitment of ownership.
- Users seek to save money by renting rather than purchasing tools.

### User Stories
1. **Tool Listing:**
   
   Enable user to see a list of tools with title, image, location, category, price, and availability.So the user can find tools based on location, availability, type, and price.


2. **Booking and Reservation:**

   A booking feature that allows users to reserve tools for specific dates.

   
3. **Contact support:**

   When a technical problem occurs, such as a malfunction in the reservation process or in communicating with the supplier.

  
4. **Contact supplier:**

   So users can communicate with the supplier about rentals, pickup, or delivery details.

    
5. **Reviews:**

   Allow users to see reviews of tools and suppliers, fostering trust and transparency within the platform.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Since the site is geared towards renting tools, most of the tools have copper or iron colors or have a black foil part. So I decided to use orange and aqua as the primary colors, in addition to using black for the background, in order to distinguish between the background and the foreground well.

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours. 

* I have used `#ff7800` as the primary color for main actions and headers.
* I have used `#26d9ff` as the secondary color for secondary actions.
* I have used `#222123` as background color for main section.
* I have used `#edefea` & `#fffbf8` as background color for seconday section and plain text.

![Color Scheme](assets/images/color-schema.webp)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue).

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald).

These fonts would provide a strong balance of readability and professionalism on a tool rental website.

### Features
